Two code repositories: One for the I2CIO driver board (I2CIO_PCF8574). The other is the controller (I2CIO_PCF_8574_TEST), which can be any I2C bus connected board.

I2CIO board code is written for the Arduino environment.  So is the example controller code, which can be ported as necessary to other development environments.
